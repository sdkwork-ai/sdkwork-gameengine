# Production Readiness Alignment Record

Status: completed
Date: 2026-07-08
Application: sdkwork-gameengine

## Objective

Bring the pre-launch SDKWork Game Engine root into a verifiable production-readiness baseline:
SDKWork-standard API envelopes, SDK-backed PC surfaces, bounded list behavior, PostgreSQL/SQLite
lifecycle parity, hardened production topology, and documentation aligned with the actual shipped
scope.

## Implemented Scope

- Database lifecycle metadata now declares active locale ownership, PostgreSQL and SQLite lifecycle
  assets, and database framework validation through `pnpm run db:validate`.
- Published API contracts stay behind generated SDK families and pass SDKWork response envelope,
  operation pattern, pagination, route manifest, and SDK generation checks.
- Room capacity is bounded in service validation, OpenAPI schemas, PostgreSQL DDL, and SQLite DDL.
- Production PC navigation exposes only SDK-backed catalog, room, active-room, IAM session mirror,
  and global read-only leaderboard surfaces.
- Retired local-only PC packages, route entries, unsupported leaderboard segments, and inactive
  i18n dictionaries are removed from the production package graph.
- Runtime topology uses SDKWork v4 two-segment profiles: `standalone.development`,
  `standalone.production`, `cloud.development`, and `cloud.production`.
- Production cloud gateway config uses explicit public hosts, no loopback upstream, restricted CORS,
  upstream readiness checks, metrics, tracing, WAF, rate limiting, and circuit breaker protection.
- Database runtime config uses structured `SDKWORK_DATABASE_*` keys. Production requires an
  explicit database config and a password file for structured PostgreSQL config.
- List/search service boundaries now reject invalid SDKWork pagination input before repository
  access. Requests with `page_size > 200`, `page = 0`, or forbidden pre-launch query aliases are
  rejected instead of being silently clamped or defaulted.
- App/backend list routes use a shared strict query extractor for list/search endpoints. Forbidden
  HTTP query aliases such as `pageSize`, `limit`, `page_no`, `pageNo`, `per_page`, and `size` now
  return SDKWork `application/problem+json` with numeric `40003 INVALID_PARAMETER` and a propagated
  `traceId`.
- The root build dispatcher rejects retired topology axis values before running workflows and runs
  production builds through `cargo build --workspace --release`.
- The PC app root pins React ambient types to its own dependency graph and deduplicates `react` and
  `react-dom` at Vite runtime resolution, preventing linked IAM/UI packages from introducing a
  second React type/runtime instance.
- Repository and PC app agent dictionaries now pass SDKWORK agent/workflow validation, and the PC app
  root owns its local `specs/component.spec.json` contract.
- Product and technical architecture docs now describe the implemented baseline and explicitly
  exclude unsupported roadmap capabilities until their API, SDK, storage, worker, authorization,
  and UI contracts are complete.

The aggregate production-readiness contract covers the PC shell, sidebar, topbar, game center,
active-room grid, leaderboard, i18n bundle, removed package directories, IAM session mirror, and
IAM-owned logout flow.

The shared topology implementation was also revalidated from `<workspace-root>/sdkwork-app-topology`
with `pnpm test` and `pnpm run validate:example` because the gameengine topology profiles consume
that shared resolver.

## Commercialization Boundary

Commercial launch readiness applies only to the documented P0 baseline: catalog, rooms, active-room
display, global read-only leaderboard, IAM-backed identity, PostgreSQL/SQLite lifecycle, SDKWork v4
topology, hardened gateway config, and signed/SBOM-gated release packaging.

Roadmap capabilities remain excluded from launch until they are complete end to end through
requirements, API, OpenAPI, generated SDK, backend service/repository implementation, worker or
async orchestration where needed, authorization policy, frontend service/UI, documentation, and
verification gates.
